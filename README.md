## Assignment 1: Simple Shell Implementation in C
### Requirements:

* Implement a basic shell program in C that supports command-line input.
* The shell should be able to execute commands entered by the user.
* Include support for basic features such as command history, input/output redirection, and background processes.
* Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each function and section.
* Use dynamic memory allocation for storing command arguments.

### Restrictions:

   * Do not use external libraries for parsing commands; implement your own parsing logic.
   *	Limit the use of global variables; prefer passing parameters between functions.
    * Do not use high-level language features that abstract away low-level details.

### Submission Guidelines:

   * Submit the source code files along with a Makefile for compilation.
   * Include a README file explaining how to compile and run your shell.
   * Provide a brief report discussing the design choices and challenges faced during implementation.
